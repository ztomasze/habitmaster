habits.models.IntervalSchedule:
* Currently like specific days, the activity needs to occur every X days on the dot.
Would be nice to make this a bit more flexible, so the habit can occur in that range.


habits.views.create:
* This could be refactored to be a bootstrap modal popup, rather than a separate static page.

* Would be nice to keep the filled input fields populated on an error.
This would require loading the context dict with all existing data and
restoring it in the webpage template.  (Too much work for right now.)

* Would be good to highlight the new habit in the resulting list when
forwarding the user back to the list of all habits.
